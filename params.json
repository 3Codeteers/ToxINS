{"name":"ToxINS","tagline":"Web Client for Tox, an open source Skype alternative.","body":"# Welcome to ToxINS!\r\nToxINS is an under-development web client for the popularity-gaining program, Tox. Tox is an Open Source alternative to Skype. Tox provides a simple core system and API, and then anyone who wants to can develop a client front-end for it. Check the project out at tox.im. ToxINS is being developed by The 3 Codeteers, and currently is only a proof-of-concept.\r\n\r\n## Features!\r\nThis section is being written. Currently, ToxINS is a featureless proof-of-concept. The User Interface is currently under construction, and neither it or the app itself is functional yet.\r\n\r\n## SECURITY!\r\nThe way that Tox works is sending messages directly. Nothing goes through a server, and nothing is saved on a server. Also Usernames aren't stored or permanent at all. Videos and audio aren't stored either. This does have some disadvantages however. Both the sending and receiving client must be on in order for a message to go through. Most clients, including ToxINS, will keep trying to send the message to the receiver, if they aren't available. They will keep trying as long as the program is on (or the website is open). Also messages and conversations that you want to save need to be saved manually. Most clients, including ToxINS, will allow you to back them up easily.\r\n\r\n## Toxins?\r\nWhy the name ToxINS? There are a few reasons.  \r\n1. We wanted a name that extended the core's name of \"Tox.\" Toxic already exists. Otherwise we would have had Tox Internet Communications. \"Toxins\" is another word with the root of Tox, although we stylize it differently.  \r\n2. \"INS\" sounded like an internet-like term. Like ISP (Internet Service Provider).  \r\n3. Finally, \"INS\" stands for \"I'm not sure\" in text lingo, and to be honest we weren't really sure of a name.\r\n\r\n## NOT Ready\r\nUnfortunately, ToxINS is still under development. It is currently nothing more than a Proof-of-Concept User Interface. It does not yet send messages or add contacts. Unfortunately this project has minimal man-power on it right now. November 2015 is when the real development will begin! But if you want, you can CONTRIBUTE now!\r\n\r\n## Support or Contact\r\nToxINS is being developed by The 3 Codeteers. This includes Republican31, empirebuilder1 (xKernel64), and BoogieRobot. However, this project is not high on our priority list right now. It will be after we finish another in November. You can contact Republican31 (project leader) at m3codeteers@gmail.com for information about the project, and how you can get involved.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
